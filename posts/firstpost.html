            <p>You may call me Crow.</p>
            <p>This website will function as my place to share short stories and essays I've written. This content will be free to view, as
                well as ad free, and will contain socialist ideals. The point of this content is to expand our readers' minds to different
                ideas.</p>
            <p>It's 2025, Trump has just been re-elected, and the stock market is likely about to collapse. The peoples constitutional
            rights are being stripped away, and the tenants of Christianity (the religion that republicans are supposedly ride or die for)
            are being openly mocked and referred to as woke, and socialist. That's right Grandma, Jesus Christ is in fact a socialist.</p>
            <p>Things are getting bad, and now more than ever the people need to be aware. We need to be cooperating, and we need to
            stop letting republicans and democrats get away with ignoring and killing us. The government is being run by the rich. The people
            who own capital, or as they're also know, the bourgeoisie. We, the regular, working class people, are being used and abused by
            these bourgeoisie for our labor, and in return we are given barely enough to survive. Meanwhile, they control the price of food,
            housing, medical care, education, and everything else we need to live. Things that should be basic human rights.</p>
            <p>Our government has demonized socialism through the use of media and education, to ensure that a capitalist economy can flourish.
            The less we know, the easier it is to pull the wool over our eyes. The most common argument against socialism is that it's idealistic,
            which isn't even a real argument. You could say that as a counter to just about anything. It's like a kid saying, "Nuh uh." So,
            let me explain how socialism would work. We start by establishing that we as human beings deserve the same, and equal rights.
            Free and affordable housing, free and affordable food, free education, and free health care for all. How does the government pay for that?
            First the government needs to fix it's budget, the spending on military both within the country, and overseas are sucking our
            budget dry. Next we impose income and wealth caps on everyone in the country. No more billionaires, no more bourgeoisie, but one
            equal class of human beings, working together to make our lives better as a collective. When you put an income cap on the citizens,
            you may think that implies that you're losing something, or that you're losing the opportunity to amass great wealth. However,
            the reality is that, in the current situation, amassing great wealth comes at the cost of others, and it's typically a very high
            cost. Whereas a cap on income would allow for us to have an income that we can all live happily on, and still be provided with
            our basic necessities by the excess wealth we're generating.</p>
            <p>The problem is, so many people are unwilling to hear this. So many people have this hard-headed, and stubborn view of things.
            The same people who claim that all lives matter, and that they're pro-life are the same people who are actively denying us, and
            themselves an economy that works for us, rather than an economy that works to keep us below those in power. I understand that
            there is an idea that people are inherently greedy and bad, but I don't subscribe that idea. I believe that humans all want the
            same thing. We all want to be happy. For some, they believe the way to get there is by stepping on whoever they have to. They
            have to see there's another way. They have to, and so does each and every one of us. Things need to change. The majority of us
            want things to change, and yet, instead of seeking it out in unknown waters, so many still cling to the traditional two parties.
            If we are to escape the circumstances that we are being held to, then we must get our toes wet. We must be willing to venture into
            the unknown together.</p>
